## Installation of rmBayes

If you have R 4.0.0 or later and use Windows or Mac, you can directly
install the rmBayes binary package via

``` r
install.packages("rmBayes", repos = "https://github.com/zhengxiaoUVic/drat", type = "binary", dependencies = TRUE)
```

Thank you, [Dr. Karim Barigou](https://github.com/kabarigou/StanMoMo), for your help with using drat. Merci.
